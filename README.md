This is my online version of the original Simon, which is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. 

Simon creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the series. 
If the user succeeds the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over. 

This app was made as a JavaScript assignment for the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).
